Gracefully terminates HTTP(S) server.

{"gitdown": "contents"}

## Behaviour

When you call [`server.close()`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_close_callback), it stops the server from accepting new connections, but it keeps the existing connections open indefinitely. This can result in your server hanging indefinitely due to keep-alive connections or because of the ongoing requests that do not produce a response. Therefore, in order to close the server, you must track creation of all connections and terminate them yourself.

http-terminator implements the logic for tracking all connections and their termination upon a timeout. http-terminator also ensures graceful communication of the server intention to shutdown to any clients that are currently receiving response from this server.

## API

```js
import {
  createHttpTerminator,
} from 'http-terminator';

/**
 * @property httpResponseTimeout Number of milliseconds to allow for the active sockets to complete serving the response (default: 1000).
 * @property server Instance of http.Server.
 */
type HttpTerminatorConfigurationInputType = {|
  +httpResponseTimeout?: number,
  +server: Server,
|};

/**
 * @property terminate Terminates HTTP server.
 */
type HttpTerminatorType = {|
  +terminate: () => Promise<void>,
|};


const httpTerminator: HttpTerminatorType = createHttpTerminator(
  configuration: HttpTerminatorConfigurationInputType
);

```

## Usage

Use `createHttpTerminator` to create an instance of http-terminator and instead of using `server.close()`, use `httpTerminator.terminate()`, e.g.

```js
import http from 'http';
import {
  createHttpTerminator,
} from 'http-terminator';

const server = http.createServer();

const httpTerminator = createHttpTerminator({
  server,
});

await httpTerminator.terminate();

```

### Usage with express.js

```js
import express from 'express';
import {
  createHttpTerminator,
} from 'http-terminator';

const app = express();

const server = app.listen();

const httpTerminator = createHttpTerminator({
  server,
});

await httpTerminator.terminate();

```

## Alternative libraries

There are several alternative libraries that implement comparable functionality, e.g.

* https://github.com/hunterloftis/stoppable
* https://github.com/thedillonb/http-shutdown
* https://github.com/tellnes/http-close

The main benefit of http-terminator is that:

* it does not monkey-patch Node.js API
* it immediately destroys all sockets without an attached HTTP request
* it allows graceful timeout to sockets with ongoing HTTP requests
* it properly handles HTTPS connections
* it informs connections using keep-alive that server is shutting down by setting a `connection: close` header
* it does not terminate the Node.js process
